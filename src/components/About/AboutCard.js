            Hi! I'm <span className="purple">Brendan Ryan</span> from <span className="purple">Chennai, India</span>.
            <br /> I'm currently pursuing a <span className="purple">Bachelor's in Computer Science (B.E CSE)</span> at St. Joseph's Institute of Technology.
            <br />
            With <span className="purple">8 months of hands-on experience</span> as a <span className="purple">Cloud Developer </span>intern, Iâ€™ve contributed to significant projects in the cloud domain, specializing in <span className="purple">AWS</span> and <span className="purple">cloud-native applications</span>.
            <br />
            <br />
            ðŸš€ My professional journey includes developing an <span className="purple">AI chatbot</span> for <span className="purple">cloud infrastructure automation</span> at <span className="purple">HiAiDo</span> and creating a <span className="purple">cloud-native solution</span> for cargo delivery and passenger rides at <span className="purple">Tesys India Pvt Ltd</span>. 
            <br />
            I've sharpened my skills in services like <span className="purple">AWS Lambda</span>, <span className="purple">AppSync</span>, and <span className="purple">S3</span>, ensuring scalable and efficient cloud solutions.
            <br />
            <br />
            ðŸŽ¯ Iâ€™m also passionate about challenges, securing <span className="purple">1st Place</span> at the 2024 <span className="purple">Rajasthan Police Hackathon</span> for building a real-time <span className="purple">financial fraud detection system</span> that helped combat fraud with an impressive <span className="purple">98% accuracy</span>.
